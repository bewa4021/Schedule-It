Help coordinate group meetings to align with a team's busy schedules.

#### Vision Statement:
"Finding Hassle-Free Meeting Times"

#### Motivation:
Eliminates inefficiency in scheduling meetings manually

#### Risks:
1. Front-End development will be a challenge
2. Meeting times (ironic)

#### Mitigation:
The group as a whole has light experience in every aspect, so we will use the group knowledge to work effectively.

#### User Stories:

1. As a student, I want to be able to input my weekly schedule so that I can plan my time and interactions more efficiently. (Estimated time: 5)

2. As a friend, I want to set up an event with others so that we can coordinate the best meeting time in our busy schedules (Estimated time: 3)

3. As a teacher, I want to be able to see when most of my students are available in a visual layout so that I can plan my office hours accordingly. (Estimate time: 2)

4. As an employer, I want to have a grouping function so that I can schedule convenient times for different teams. (Estimated time: 3)

5. As a business owner, I want to be able to send an invitation to a meeting, or to the platform, so that our interaction is as convenient as possible. (Estimated time: 2)

6. As an personal individual, I want to be able to choose who can see my schedules so that I can keep my work and social life separate. (Estimated time: 8)
